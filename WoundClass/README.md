The folders have to be merged with the same named folders in the Unreal project structure of a new project. The Plugin folder is important to use the plugin OpenCV and the Binaries/Win64 Folder Contains the opencv_world.dll file, that Unreal needs when starting the Editor. If it is not there, Unreal will throw an exception while loading the project with the plugin. The Windows Mixed Reality Kit (i.e. UXTools) is a dependency of the Plugin.
